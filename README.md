# robot-framework-automation-portfolio

A complete cross-platform automation portfolio demonstrating practical scripts for **Web, iOS, Android, and API testing**. This repository showcases my ability to create robust, maintainable, and efficient automation solutions that mirror real-world testing scenarios.

### Platforms and Open-Source Integrations

Automation scripts leverage multiple platforms and open-source tools:

- **Web automation** using **OrangeHRM**  
- **iOS and Android automation** via **Sauce Labs**  
- **API automation** with **Reqres.in**  

### Key Features

- **BDD-style test implementation** for clear, human-readable, and maintainable scenarios  
- **Test data management** with Excel for easy configuration and scalable, data-driven testing  
- **Reporting** in both **PDF** and **Excel** formats, offering detailed and professional test results  

### Highlights

Through this portfolio, I demonstrate my capability to:

- Design **scalable cross-platform automation solutions**  
- Implement **data-driven testing** for flexibility and maintainability  
- Generate **comprehensive, exportable reports** for analysis and decision-making  
- Leverage **real-world open-source platforms** for hands-on automation experience  

This repository serves as both a **showcase of my work** and a **reference for best practices in automation** across multiple platforms and technologies.
