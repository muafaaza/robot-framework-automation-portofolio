This repository contains my portfolio of automation scripts for web, iOS, Android, and API testing. It showcases practical implementations across multiple platforms, demonstrating expertise in building robust, maintainable, and efficient automation solutions.

Specifically, it includes:

- **Web automation** using **OrangeHRM**  
- **iOS and Android automation** via **Sauce Labs**  
- **API automation** with **Reqres.in**  

These scripts highlight my ability to design scalable, cross-platform automation solutions inspired by real-world open-source platforms.
